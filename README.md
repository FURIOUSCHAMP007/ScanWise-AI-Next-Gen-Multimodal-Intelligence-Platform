## 💎 Executive Overview

ScanWise AI is an enterprise-grade Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platform designed to eliminate diagnostic silos across radiology, laboratory systems, and electronic health record ecosystems.

By synthesizing:

- High-resolution DICOM imaging
- Longitudinal laboratory biomarkers
- Real-time clinical documentation

the platform establishes a **single source of clinical truth** for high-confidence triage, differential diagnosis, and transplant intelligence workflows.

Powered by a multi-agent architecture leveraging Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash, ScanWise AI performs deep cross-modal reasoning—verifying imaging abnormalities against biochemical markers and structured EHR tensors.

# 🚀 Core Clinical Modules

## 1️⃣ Multimodal Agentic Ingestion

Secure entry layer for all medical data streams.

- AI modality detection (MRI, CT, X-ray, Lab Report)
- Automated anatomical localization
- Local PHI/PII stripping prior to cloud inference
- PACS-ready DICOM compatibility
- OCR extraction from unstructured documents

**Output:** Structured, anonymized clinical tensors ready for reasoning.

---

## 2️⃣ Clinical Reasoning & Analysis

Cross-modal diagnostic intelligence engine.

- Dual inference pipeline
  - Gemini 3 Flash → OCR + summarization
  - Gemini 3 Pro → Differential diagnosis modeling
- Imaging–Lab correlation
- ROI heatmapping for lesion localization
- Explainable reasoning trees
- Live voice-enabled peer-review assistant

**Output:** High-confidence, transparent diagnostic hypotheses.

---

## 3️⃣ Operational Triage Dashboard

Mission-control layer for hospital operations.

- Predictive workload forecasting
- Queue velocity tracking
- Regional trauma mapping
- Modality distribution analytics
- AI-generated executive clinical briefings

**Output:** Data-driven triage prioritization and equipment optimization.

---

## 4️⃣ Transplant Intelligence Hub

High-stakes organ allocation support module.

- Automated MELD, EPTS, LAS scoring
- Cold Ischemia Time (CIT) monitoring
- Organ viability window alerts
- Multi-factor HLA + blood type matching
- Logistics simulation (air + ground routing)

**Output:** Compliance-aligned transplant decision augmentation.

---

## 5️⃣ Patient-Centric Communication

Bridging technical diagnostics and patient understanding.

- Radiology jargon → Plain-language translation
- Health literacy optimization
- Structured “What’s Next” guidance
- Secure patient-clinician communication bridge

**Output:** Improved clarity, trust, and adherence.

---

## 6️⃣ EHR Bridge (FHIR R4)

Interoperability backbone of ScanWise AI.

- Bidirectional FHIR R4 synchronization
- AI-tensor mapping to:
  - Problem List
  - Assessment & Plan
  - Observations
  - Procedures
- Unit normalization (metric/imperial)
- ISO-8601 standardization
- Immutable audit ledger

**Output:** Seamless integration into major EMR systems.

# 📑 Agentic Workflow

1. Ingestion → De-identification + modality detection  
2. Reasoning → Imaging ↔ Lab correlation  
3. Grounding → Validation against recent clinical research  
4. Action → Clinical Handshake generation  
5. Integration → FHIR-based EHR push  

---

# 🔐 Regulatory Positioning

ScanWise AI is a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool.

- Assists licensed healthcare professionals
- Provides multimodal correlation
- Does not replace independent clinical judgment

All transplant allocations must follow national procurement protocols and be validated by certified transplant coordinators.
